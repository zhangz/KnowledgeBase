## HashSet\<T\> vs. List\<T\>
- HashSet contains only unique members.
- HashSet is optimised for searching (contains, remove) - hash lookups are fast.
- HashSet provides some very useful set operations such as IsSubsetOf and Overlaps, both can be achieved on the other collection types using LINQ but HashSet provides an optimized, ready-made solution
- HashSet doesn't implement `IList` only `ICollection`
- You cannot use indices with a HashSet, only enumerators.
- List has faster speed at adding new items, given that HashSet ensures that are no duplicated, there is much more overhead when dealing with reference types!
- HashSet.Add will skip a new item if it's deemed equal to one of the existing items and return false.
- Dictionary.Add will throw an exception if the new key being added is deemed equal to one of the existing keys. However, if you use the Dictionaryâ€˜s indexer instead, it will replace the existing item if the new item is deemed equal to it.
- List.Add will simply add the same item twice.

Use a List if you just need a List to keep track of items, and when you want to iterate through the collection; use a Dictionary if you require hash lookup against some value; use a hash set if you need to perform set operations (e.g. set comparison, determine subset/superset relationship) frequently.

## HybridDictionary

Implements `IDictionary` by using a `ListDictionary` while the collection is small, and then switching to a `Hashtable` when the collection gets large.
